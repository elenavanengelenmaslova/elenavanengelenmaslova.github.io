        I am <strong>Elena van Engelen-Maslova</strong>, a Senior/Lead Software Engineer with over two decades of experience. I specialize in Kotlin and Java backend development, with strong expertise in DevOps, cloud-native solutions (AWS, Azure), and event-driven architectures.

        My primary focus is on delivering scalable and maintainable software by applying serverless cloud architectures, microservices, and event-driven patterns. I value delivering results quickly while maintaining a high standard of quality and reducing waste.
