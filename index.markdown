With over two decades of experience in Kotlin and Java backend development, I specialize in designing and implementing cloud-native architectures, microservices, and event-driven patterns. I am the author of [*Kotlin Crash Course*](https://www.amazon.com/Kotlin-Crash-Course-Fast-track-programming/dp/9355516304), a comprehensive guide to mastering Kotlin from basics to advanced concepts.

As a 5x AWS and 2x Azure-certified professional, I bring extensive expertise in building scalable, maintainable software solutions. My focus is on delivering high-quality results efficiently while ensuring clean, reusable code and reducing waste.

I collaborate with teams, mentor peers, and share knowledge to foster innovation. Beyond my immediate projects, I write about Kotlin and cloud-native solutions on my [blog](https://medium.com/@elenavanengelen) and share insights at conferences like [Kotlin Dev Day Advanced](https://kotlindevday.com/videos/kotlin-on-serverless-cloud-aws-lambda-unlimited-elena-van-engelen-maslova/).

In addition to software engineering, I provide Kotlin training sessions to help teams enhance their skills and productivity. Learn more on my [Training](/training/) page.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, yoga, cross-country skiing, and exploring new places with my two kids.
