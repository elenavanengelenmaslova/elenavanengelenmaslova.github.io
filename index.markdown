As an independent Senior/Lead Software Engineer working on a freelance basis, I help businesses design and implement scalable, maintainable backend systems using Kotlin and Java. I specialize in **cloud-native architectures**, **microservices**, and **event-driven patterns**, ensuring high-quality results tailored to meet business needs.

I have worked with leading organizations to deliver impactful solutions, leveraging my [AWS and Azure certifications](/credentials/) and extensive expertise in building secure, efficient systems. Explore my recent projects and achievements in my [Portfolio](/portfolio/).

In addition to software engineering, I provide **Kotlin training sessions** to help teams enhance their skills and productivity. My training programs are based on practical, real-world experience and include content from my book, [*Kotlin Crash Course*](https://www.amazon.com/Kotlin-Crash-Course-Fast-track-programming/dp/9355516304)—a comprehensive guide to learning Kotlin, from basics to advanced concepts. Learn more about my tailored training programs on the [Training](/training/) page.

Beyond my immediate projects, I write about Kotlin and cloud-native solutions on my [blog](https://medium.com/@elenavanengelen) and share insights at conferences like [Kotlin Dev Day Advanced](https://kotlindevday.com/videos/kotlin-on-serverless-cloud-aws-lambda-unlimited-elena-van-engelen-maslova/).

Outside of work, I enjoy running, yoga, cross-country skiing, and spending time with my kids & family.
