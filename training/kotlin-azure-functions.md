## Course Overview
This **practical training** focuses on building **serverless applications with Kotlin on Azure Functions**. Designed for **intermediate Kotlin developers**, this course teaches how to **write, deploy, and manage event-driven functions in a cloud-native environment**.

This training assumes **prior Kotlin knowledge** (completion of **Kotlin Crash Course** or **Bite-Size Kotlin Training**, or equivalent experience).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Learn how to **write Kotlin-based Azure Functions** and manage dependencies.
- Deploy **Azure Functions using Kotlin and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**.
- Work with **various Azure Function triggers**: HTTP, Timer (cron jobs), Service Bus, Blob Storage, and Event Hubs.
- Implement **output integrations**, allowing Azure Functions to send data to **Service Bus, Cosmos DB, and Blob Storage**.
- Implement **error handling and logging** using **Application Insights**.

## Course Structure
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Format**: Onsite or Remote

### **Day 1: Writing & Deploying Kotlin Functions on Azure**
- **Introduction to Azure Functions**: Event-driven computing and best practices.
- **Setting up the Azure development environment**: Tools and prerequisites.
- **Writing Kotlin-based Azure Functions**: Runtime considerations and dependencies.
- **Triggering Functions**:
    - **HTTP Triggers** for direct API calls.
    - **Timer (Cron) Triggers** for scheduled executions.
    - **Service Bus Triggers** for event-driven messaging.
    - **Blob Storage Triggers** for file processing.
    - **Event Hubs Triggers** for real-time event ingestion.

### **Day 2: Output Integrations, IaC & Deployment**
- **Azure Function Output Integrations**:
    - **Sending messages to Service Bus** for further processing.
    - **Writing to Cosmos DB** for database persistence.
    - **Saving files to Blob Storage** for cloud storage.
- **Error handling & logging**: Application Insights integration.
