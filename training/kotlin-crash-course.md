## Course Overview
This **intensive one-week training program** is designed for developers who want to **learn Kotlin quickly** with a hands-on approach. Based on **Kotlin Crash Course**, the training covers **Kotlin fundamentals, OOP, collections, functional programming, coroutines, delegation pattern, and unit testing**.

Participants will complete **practical exercises and build real-world applications** throughout the week.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Gain **proficiency in Kotlinâ€™s core syntax** and best practices.
- Write **clean, maintainable Kotlin code** following industry standards.
- Use **null safety mechanisms** to prevent common runtime errors.
- Apply **object-oriented programming** principles in Kotlin.
- Work with **Kotlin collections** to manage and process data efficiently.
- Implement **functional programming** techniques using lambdas and higher-order functions.
- Work with **coroutines** for efficient asynchronous programming.
- Apply **delegation pattern** to simplify and reuse code.
- Write **unit tests in Kotlin** using JUnit and MockK.
- Develop a **real-world Kotlin application** using IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle.

## Course Structure
**Duration**: 1 week (Full-day sessions)  
**Format**: Onsite or Remote

### **Day 1: Kotlin Fundamentals**
- **Introduction to Kotlin**: Language features, ecosystem, and advantages.
- **Development environment setup**: IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, project configuration.
- **Basic syntax**: Variables, functions, expressions, and statements.
- **Control flow statements**: `if`, `when`, loops, and structured error handling.

### **Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining and using classes.
- **Inheritance and Interfaces**: Designing modular and reusable code.
- **Visibility Modifiers**: Understanding access control in Kotlin.
- **Data Classes and Singleton Objects**.

### **Day 3: Collections, Functional Programming & Coroutines**
- **Working with Collections**: Lists, Sets, Maps, filtering, sorting.
- **Lambdas and Higher-Order Functions**.
- **Scope Functions**: `let`, `run`, `apply`, `also`, `with`.
- **Introduction to Coroutines**: Suspending functions, structured concurrency, launching coroutines.

### **Day 4: Delegation Pattern & Unit Testing**
- **Delegation in Kotlin**: Using `by` keyword for cleaner architecture.
- **Testing Kotlin Code**: Writing and running tests with JUnit & MockK.
- **Mocking dependencies and verifying behavior**.

### **Day 5: Real-World Kotlin Application**
- **Applying all concepts in a hands-on project**.
- **Refactoring and optimizing Kotlin code**.
- **Writing clean documentation using KDoc**.

## Who Should Attend?
