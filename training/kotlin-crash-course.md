## Course Overview
This **intensive one-week training program** is designed for developers who want to **learn Kotlin quickly** with a hands-on approach. Based on [**Kotlin Crash Course**](https://www.amazon.com/Kotlin-Crash-Course-Fast-track-programming/dp/9355516304) book, the training covers **Kotlin fundamentals, OOP, collections, functional programming, coroutines, delegation pattern, and unit testing**.

Participants will **develop hands-on projects** as they learn new concepts throughout the week.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Gain **proficiency in Kotlinâ€™s core syntax** and best practices.
- Write **clean, maintainable Kotlin code** following industry standards.
- Use **null safety mechanisms** to prevent common runtime errors.
- Apply **object-oriented programming** principles in Kotlin.
- Work with **Kotlin collections** to manage and process data efficiently.
- Implement **functional programming** techniques using lambdas and higher-order functions.
- Work with **coroutines** for efficient asynchronous programming.
- Apply **delegation pattern** to simplify and reuse code.
- Write **unit tests in Kotlin** using JUnit and MockK.
- Develop **a variety of Kotlin applications** using IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle.

## Course Structure
