## Course Overview
This **remote training program** is designed for teams who want to **gradually master Kotlin** over **three months**. The training follows a structured approach based on **Kotlin Crash Course**, covering **fundamentals, object-oriented programming, collections, functional programming, coroutines, delegation pattern, and unit testing**.

Each session includes **practical exercises and real-world applications**, ensuring that participants **apply their learning incrementally**.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Gain a **deep understanding of Kotlin fundamentals** and best practices.
- Learn how to **write idiomatic and maintainable Kotlin code**.
- Master **null safety** techniques and avoid common pitfalls.
- Work with **control flow statements** (`if`, `when`, loops) to manage logic.
- Use **Kotlin collections** effectively for data manipulation.
- Apply **object-oriented principles**, including classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- Understand **functional programming concepts** and write concise Kotlin code.
- Work with **coroutines** for efficient asynchronous programming.
- Implement the **delegation pattern** to improve code structure.
- Gain hands-on experience with **unit testing** using Kotlin test frameworks.

## Course Structure
**Duration**: 3 months (1 session per week, 4 hours per session)  
**Format**: Remote (live interactive sessions)

### **Month 1: Kotlin Fundamentals**
- **Introduction to Kotlin**: Language overview and advantages.
- **Setting up the development environment**: IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle.
- **Basic syntax**: Variables (`val` vs `var`), type inference, functions.
- **Control flow statements**: `if`, `when`, loops, exception handling.
- **Null safety and best practices**.

### **Month 2: Advanced Kotlin Concepts**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, interfaces, and inheritance.
- **Kotlin Collections**: Lists, Sets, Maps, filtering, and sorting.
- **Functional Programming**: Lambdas, higher-order functions, and immutability.
- **Delegation Pattern**: Best practices for code reuse and maintainability.

### **Month 3: Coroutines, Testing & Real-World Applications**
- **Coroutines & Asynchronous Programming**: Suspending functions, structured concurrency.
- **Unit Testing in Kotlin**: Writing and running tests with JUnit & MockK.
- **Best practices for clean code and project organization**.
- **Hands-on Kotlin development exercises**.
- **Final project: Implementing a real-world Kotlin application**.

## Who Should Attend?
- **Developers new to Kotlin** who prefer a **gradual, applied learning approach**.
- **Java developers** transitioning to Kotlin.
- **Teams adopting Kotlin for backend or cloud-based applications**.
