## Course Overview
This **hands-on training** focuses on building serverless applications using **Kotlin on AWS Lambda**. Designed for **intermediate Kotlin developers**, this course dives into **writing, deploying, and managing AWS Lambda functions** while using **AWS CDK for infrastructure as code**.

This training assumes **prior Kotlin knowledge** (completion of **Kotlin Crash Course** or **Bite-Size Kotlin Training**, or equivalent experience).

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this training, participants will:
- Learn how to **write AWS Lambda functions in Kotlin** and manage dependencies.
- Set up **AWS CDK with Kotlin** to deploy Lambda functions and infrastructure.
- Work with **various Lambda triggers**: API Gateway, EventBridge, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB Streams, and S3.
- Implement **output integrations**, enabling Lambda to send data to **S3, DynamoDB, SNS, SQS, and EventBridge**.
- Implement **error handling and logging** using **Kotlin Logging**.
- Optimize **AWS Lambda performance** using **AWS SnapStart** and cold start reduction techniques.

## Course Structure
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Format**: Onsite or Remote

### **Day 1: Writing & Deploying Kotlin Functions on AWS Lambda**
- **Introduction to AWS Lambda**: Event-driven computing and best practices.
- **Setting up AWS CDK in Kotlin**: Automating Lambda deployments.
- **Writing Kotlin-based Lambda functions**: Dependencies, serialization, and testing.
- **Triggering Lambda functions**:
    - **API Gateway** for HTTP requests.
    - **EventBridge** for event-driven architectures.
    - **SQS & SNS** for messaging and decoupling services.
    - **DynamoDB Streams** for real-time processing.
    - **S3 Events** for processing file uploads.

### **Day 2: Output Integrations, Logging & Optimization**
- **Lambda Output Integrations**:
    - **Writing to S3** for event-driven file storage.
    - **Saving data to DynamoDB** for state persistence.
    - **Publishing messages to SNS/SQS** for further processing.
    - **Sending events to EventBridge** for event-driven workflows.
- **Error handling & logging**: Implementing structured logging with Kotlin.
- **Performance optimization**:
    - Reducing cold starts with **AWS SnapStart**.
    - Provisioned Concurrency and memory tuning.
- **Building a complete serverless application in Kotlin**.

## Who Should Attend?
- **Intermediate Kotlin developers** looking to build AWS serverless applications.
- **Backend engineers** who want to use **Kotlin with AWS CDK & Lambda**.
- **Teams adopting Kotlin** for cloud-native applications.
