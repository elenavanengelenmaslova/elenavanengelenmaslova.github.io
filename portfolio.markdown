I partner with enterprise engineering teams to design and deliver cloud-native, Kotlin-based systems on AWS and Azure, supporting scalability, reliability, and clear architecture practices.
I have worked across a wide spectrum of projects, from secure enterprise integrations to event-driven and serverless platforms. Below are selected examples that highlight practical results and hands-on impact in modern cloud environments.
