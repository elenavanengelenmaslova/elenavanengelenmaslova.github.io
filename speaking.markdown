I regularly speak at conferences and meetups about Kotlin, cloud-native development and design. My sessions focus on practical insights, developer experience, and building real-world systems with serverless technologies across AWS and Azure, typically featuring live coding and a live demo.
**Available for guest speaking on Kotlin and/or Serverless Cloud Topics**, [get in touch](mailto:elenavanengelen@vintik.nl).
