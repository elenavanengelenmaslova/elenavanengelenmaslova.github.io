I provide Kotlin training sessions designed to help teams enhance their skills, boost productivity, and build confidence in using Kotlin effectively. My training offerings cover a range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced Kotlin techniques, and can be customized to meet your team’s specific needs. These sessions are available in various formats, including:

- **Intensive Kotlin Basics Training**: A fast-paced course, typically conducted over two days, designed to get your team up to speed with Kotlin fundamentals.
- **Bite-Size Kotlin Sessions**: 4-hour weekly sessions, typically conducted over 3 months, designed for Kotlin teams who wish to learn incrementally and apply new concepts directly to their work as they progress.
- **Kotlin Crash Course**: A comprehensive training program based on my book. This course guides developers from basics to advanced Kotlin concepts and can be conducted as an intensive week-long program or at a slower pace over an extended period.
